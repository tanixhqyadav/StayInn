# StayInn
StayInn (To-Let Platform) | October 2024 â€“ December 2024
Built a hotel booking platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

Integrated Razorpay for secure and seamless real-time payment processing.

Developed features like hostel/hotel listings, real-time booking confirmation, and an admin dashboard for property owners to manage their listings, bookings, and revenue.

Designed an intuitive, responsive dashboard using React and Tailwind CSS, improving usability for both users and administrators.

Implemented backend APIs for user authentication, booking management, and listing control using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB for database storage.

Future roadmap includes:

AI-powered stay recommendations using user behavior analysis (possibly via machine learning models integrated with the backend).

Emergency Stay Finder feature for last-minute accommodations, leveraging real-time availability checks and location-based filtering.
